Summary:
Learning visual classifiers from weakly labeled data is a hard problem which involves finding a correspondence between the nouns and image regions. To improve visual classifiers for object recognition using weakly labelled data, the authors consider prepositions and adjectives, and not just nouns, to constrain the determination of the correspondence between image regions and semantic object classes. This helps learn object relationships which help solve the correspondence ambiguities. They simultaneously learn the visual features defining “nouns” and the differential visual features defining such “binary-relationships” using an EM-based approach. They also present a more constrained Bayesian model with priors over relationships between nouns for the labeling process. Experimental results show that using relationship words helps in reduction of correspondence ambiguity and using a constrained model leads to a better labeling performance.
